This mark my first night on github.com 21 october 2016, 01:31pm
I would first of all say hello to everyone who is here.
My dream for a long time was to be developper and be part of people who impact thsis world.
I'm actually working in advetising company but my long term goal is to work in a sofware company.
My hobbies are programming and reading news of technologies.
I listen to the country music and pop.
